Tagore once said: Silence is a virtue, but silence in front of someone you like is cowardice.

After returning home from get off work yesterday, I found that I couldn’t remotely connect to the company’s computer. I really had to work overtime at home on May 1st, so I simply went back to the company to check the situation. After a quick solution, I came back from the company and got on the bus at the fruit lake station and met a girl. Late, probably because of the holiday, the subway was empty, so I sat down, but this girl stood there, I looked at her, she looked at me, the eyes of the strangers converged, and of course they quickly passed away, She shrugged her shoulders slightly, leaned against the door relaxedly, and I lowered my head to reply to the message.

 When I arrived at Yuejiazui, I changed to Line 4, and rested for the holidays. Everyone’s steps showed their eagerness. The next trip was still two minutes away. I looked to the right and found that the girl from Fruit Lake walked to the carriage next to me. Getting interested, I walked behind her and waited for the car, got in the car, she looked at me, I looked at her, this time it was still a brief look at each other, and then each was bored, the world began to fall silent, only the sound of the subway clattering.

 When I got to Garden Road, there were many people in the carriages and almost everyone got off. She didn’t get off, and I didn’t get off. I don’t know why, so I started to guess in my heart. I won't get off at the same stop on Renhe Road. I bet on which exit she came from, and whether she will go to the right when she goes out. He quickened his pace and walked in front of her. He shouldn't be so bored to pay attention to these things. He looked back at her, and then walked faster and further away from her. When he walked downstairs, there were not many people at the nucleic acid point in the square, so he hesitated. When I was in a daze, I turned around subconsciously, and when I saw her approaching, I actually started to struggle whether I should talk to her, even if I said "Sister, we meet again", I still spread the word. Cowardly, I turned my back to her, decided to be a nucleic acid, and stood in line, I stared at her in a daze, but she walked in front of me, and then passed by, I looked at her in a direction that was not a team, I was relaxed. I sighed, and then looked at my phone, I was shy and frivolous and thought that if she came to do nucleic acid, I would say hello to her, after all, she has gone far, and even if she walked all the way, she was still a passerby, I thought This scene shook my head slightly, but when I looked up again, I saw her walking towards me. At that moment, my heart was full of waves. I became a little nervous, flustered, and tangled. We made eye contact again, and I watched her carefully. It looks like, my intuition tells me that she should get married at this state and age. She stood behind me, but I was even more nervous, with a trace of regret in my nervousness, because I was cowardly and quickly left after knowing that I had finished the nucleic acid. It was only after a last glance at her from a distance around the corner that I completely relaxed and went upstairs to go home.

 However, the next day I met her again in the elevator..
